## Project Overview

- Web Application for management of grades and marks of students for a School/University.
- Implemented using Django framework along with PostgreSQL database.
- A simple development cycle with stages including Documentation, Designing, Coding, Testing and Improvement was practiced.
- to meet the requirements of [assignment](./Documents/7420_S1_2023_Assignment_1.pdf), I made a [checklist](./Documents/Checklist.md) to tick off once developed.
- [Developer Journal](./Documents/Developer_Journal.md) to record the learning and development progress.


## Troubleshot
- if  port 8000 is occupied, for example if 86597, then use `kill -9 86597` in terminal
```terminal
sudo lsof -t -i tcp:8000
```

## Project setup with Pycharm

- [x] upgraded pip with the my project python 3.10.6, `pip install --upgrade pip`
- [x] Git: using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- [x] DB: using [PostgreSQL](./Documents/PostgreSQL_Setup.md) set up
- [x] DB management tool: using [Data Grip](./Documents/Data_Grip.md) to set up, this is similar to PgAdmin4, but more advanced.
- [x] Best practice to manage DB confidential: see [guide](./Documents/Environment_Variables.md)
- [x] `django debug toolbar`: follow [link](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- [x] `pylint-django`: terminal `pip install pylint-django`

    above is for Pycharm, also can set up with== [VS Code](./Documents/VSCode_Setup.md)

## Base function development
- [x] **Create the Models** refer to the diagram
![ERD generated by Data_Grip](./Documents/ERD.png)
- [x]  Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to apply the model changes
- [x] Test the models in the Django shell to handle CRUD operations for 'Semester' field
- [x] Generic Views and templates for 'Semester'
- [x] Use Django's generic views and forms to handle CRUD operations for [Admin panel](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/admin/)

---
## Wireframes
- [x] Once the models.py is developed, draw UI and pages to continue the project development.Similar UI for other tables (classes)

## Feature Development:

- [x] **More Templates, Views, and Forms**
- [x] In gradebook_app/templates/, create the necessary templates for lecturers, and students
- [x] Use template inheritance to reuse common components (e.g. header, footer)
- [x] implementing user authentication: Set up user authentication to allow users to register, log in, and log out. Use Django's built-in authentication views and forms for this purpose. You can create custom templates and views to fit your app's design if needed.
- [ ] admin can enroll/remove/update students to/from a class
- [x] admin can assign/remove/update lecturers to/from a class
- [ ] Lectures can enter studentsâ€™ marks in the gradebook
- [ ] Students can view their marks in the gradebook
- [ ] The system can email students when their marks are ready
- [ ] Administrator can upload students from excel files to the website

- [ ] **Test the application**

- [ ] **Prepare for Deployment 
- [ ] Create `runtime.txt` with the required Python version
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- [ ] Commit and push changes to GitHub

- [ ] **Deploy to Doc hyper server**
- [ ] Follow the instructions provided by Doc hyper to deploy the app

### Notes
what need to cover requirements for the project
ERD
2. list of cover CRUD for the DB
- develop and test independent models and then develop related models
- views
- urls
- postman to test?
- Django REST API
1. Generic class (UTIL?) avoid repeated coding, like a template class
2. security things to do at the end
