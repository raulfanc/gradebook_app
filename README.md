## Project Overview

- Web Application for management of grades and marks of students for a School/University.
- Implemented using Django framework along with PostgreSQL database.
- A simple development cycle with stages including Documentation, Designing, Coding, Testing and Improvement was practiced.

## Project setup
- [Checklist](./Documents/Checklist.md) to tick off once developed.
- [Developer Journal](./Documents/Developer_Journal.md) to record the learning and development progress.
- Git Management: using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- DataBase: using [PostgreSQL](./Documents/PostgreSQL_Setup.md)
- DB management: using [Data Grip](./Documents/Data_Grip.md), this is similar to PgAdmin4, but more advanced.
- Best practice to confidential: see [os.env](./Documents/os.env.md)
- [Wireframes](./Documents/Wireframe.md) for UI
- Email SMTP service with [GMail](./Documents/SMTP_Gmail.md)
- upload_student function need to use [test.xlsx](./Documents/test.xlsx)
- `django debug toolbar`: follow [link](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

**can be set up with: [VS Code](./Documents/VSCode_Setup.md)**

## Troubleshot

- upgraded pip with the my project python 3.10.6, `pip install --upgrade pip`
- use `sudo lsof -t -i tcp:8000` to monitor the port 8000, if  port 8000 is occupied, for example if 86597, then use `kill -9 86597` in terminal

## Project Structure
##### used built-in admin site 
- to manage **the backend CRUD** ([admin.py](./gradebook_app/admin.py) working with [models.py](./gradebook_app/models.py))

##### User Authentication
- Function-based user registration in ([views.py](./gradebook_app/views.py) 
- Function-based user update profile (choose 'student' or 'lecturer' group) in [views.py](./gradebook_app/views.py), [forms.py](./gradebook_app/forms.py) & [group_tags.py](./gradebook_app/templatetags/group_tags.py)
- User login is managed by built-in user authentication system
- templates are developed in [registration folder](./gradebook_app/templates/registration)

##### Upload students is developped within the admin site
-  is managed by function-based [upload_student view](./gradebook_app/views.py), [StudentAdmin class](./gradebook_app/admin.py)
- UI is customised in the admin site, to see [templates](templates/admin/gradebook_app/student)
- [test.xlsx](./Documents/test.xlsx) is used to test the upload function

##### Other functions
- `Student assign to class` is managed by [EnrollmentAdmin class](./gradebook_app/admin.py)
- `Lecturer assign to class` is managed by [LecturerAdmin class](./gradebook_app/admin.py)
- `Enter marks` is managed by [EnrolmentListView class](./gradebook_app/views.py) & [EnrolmentUpdateView class](./gradebook_app/views.py)
- `View marks` is managed by [StudentEnrolmentListView](./gradebook_app/views.py) & [StudentEnrolmentDetailView](./gradebook_app/views.py)
- `Email Students` is managed by function-based [send_email_view](./gradebook_app/views.py)

##### Extended codebase for **a future customised administrator**
- Generic view coded in ([views.py](./gradebook_app/views.py), 
- Display control [forms.py](./gradebook_app/forms.py)) 
- only tested with `Semester` model's CRUD [templates](./gradebook_app/templates/gradebook_app/)
- Rest of models shall repeatedly follow `Semester` model's CRUD [templates](./gradebook_app/templates/gradebook_app/)

**NOTE:** since I've used the admin-site to manage the CRUD, so I didn't use the generic view for this project.
