## Project Overview

- Web Application for management of grades and marks of students for a School/University.
- Implemented using Django framework along with PostgreSQL database.
- A simple development cycle with stages including Documentation, Designing, Coding, Testing and Improvement was practiced.
- to meet the requirements of [assignment](./Documents/7420_S1_2023_Assignment_1.pdf), I made a [checklist](./Documents/Checklist.md) to tick off once developed.
- [Developer Journal](./Documents/Developer_Journal.md) to record the learning and development progress.


## Troubleshot
- if  port 8000 is occupied, for example if 86597, then use `kill -9 86597` in terminal
```terminal
sudo lsof -t -i tcp:8000
```

![ERD generated by Data_Grip](./Documents/ERD.png)
- [x]  Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to apply the model changes
- [x] Test the models in the Django shell to handle CRUD operations for 'Semester' field
- [x] Generic Views and templates for 'Semester'
- [x] Use Django's generic views and forms to handle CRUD operations for [Admin panel](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/admin/)

**after this development, can use similar implementations for other models**

## refer to [Checklist](./Documents/Checklist) for the rest of functionalities

---
## Wireframes
- [x] Once the models.py is developed, draw UI and pages to continue the project development.Similar UI for other tables (classes)
