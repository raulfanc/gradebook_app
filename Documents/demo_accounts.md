for test with current database, I've set some account to play with functions

##### Admin's accounts
- `admin`: most of my test is done with admin account

##### Lecturer's accounts
- `t1`: not assigned in any classes, when logged in, cannot see the lecturer's section
- `t6`: assigned in a class, when logged in, can see the lecturer's section

#### Student's accounts
- `s2`: assigned in a class, when logged in, can see the student's section
