it is not recommended to store sensitive information like database credentials in the source code or version control system. To avoid this, can use ==environment variables== to store sensitive data and configure your Django project to read those variables. 

1.  First, install the `python-dotenv` package to manage environment variables from a `.env` file:
```terminal
pip install python-dotenv
```

2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your Django project (the same directory as your ==`manage.py`== file). Add your database credentials to the file, replace xxx with the actual info
```python
DB_NAME=<xxx>
DB_USER=<xxx>
DB_PASSWORD=<xxx>
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

3. Add the ==`.env`== file to your ==`.gitignore`== file to **prevent it from being tracked by Git**
4. In your ==`settings.py`== file, import the `os` module and load the environment variables from the `.env` file using `load_dotenv`:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```
5.  Update your `DATABASES` settings to use the environment variables:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.getenv('DB_NAME'),
        'USER': os.getenv('DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': os.getenv('DB_HOST'),
        'PORT': os.getenv('DB_PORT'),
    }
}
```
Now, ==`settings.py`== file will read the database credentials from the environment variables defined in the `.env` file. This keeps sensitive data out of your version control system.

Remember to share the `.env` file or the environment variables with your team members securely, so they can configure their development environments accordingly.
